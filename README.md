This repository contains the code for Keshopan Arunthavachelvan's interview submission for the React Native Software Developer position at Red Thread Innovations.

**About the Project**

In this project, a mobile app is created for android and iOS to display the top 20 popular movies currently airing, allowing the user to select a movie and view the respective movie details. 

**Before Running**

The app requires an API token from TheMovieDB. Once you obtain your API token from the platform, include this token on the variable assignment for **API_TOKEN** in the **assessment/constants/API.tsx** file.
